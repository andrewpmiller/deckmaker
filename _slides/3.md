## The Third Slide is all about code

Add this function to `.bash_aliases`

```
# Move the given file(s) to the Trash.
function trash {
  local path;
  for path; do
    # Make relative paths "absolutey".
    [ "${path:0:1}" = '/' ] || path="$PWD/$1";

    # Execute the AppleScript to nudge Finder.
    echo "$(cat <<-EOD
      tell application "Finder"
        delete POSIX file "${path//\"/\"}"
      end
    EOD)" | osascript;
  done;
}

```
