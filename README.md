# deckmaker

## A simple-ish way to generate a Reveal.js slide deck using Jekyll.

This repo adds very little to the hard work that these clever people have generously shared:

- Jason Gowans' [blog post](https://medium.com/aerobatic-blog/building-a-reveal-js-presentation-with-jekyll-collections-52bcdba4114a)
- Nate Goldman's [Jekyll-Reveal project](https://github.com/ungoldman/jekyll-reveal)
- Luu Gia Thuy's [modest Gist](https://gist.github.com/luugiathuy/c07ac5608addadb642e5) that solves most of the challenges.
